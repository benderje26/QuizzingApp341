Welcome to our group's coding standards! It is split up into a few different sections, and if anything is
confusing, just ask someone else!

C# Standards:
Our C# standards are designed to promote clean, consistent, and readable code across our project.

Naming Conventions.

Class Names: Use PascalCase for all class names, where each word is capitalized.
Example: public class HomeScreen { }

Method Names: Use PascalCase for all method names. Methods that return a boolean should start with "Is" or "Has" to indicate a true/false outcome.
Example: public bool IsCurrentQuestionMultipleChoice() { return true; }
Variable Names: Use camelCase for local variables and parameters. Avoid single-character variable names.
Example:

Constants: Use uppercase letters with underscores for constants.
Example: 

Private Fields: Use camelCase, starting with an underscore.
Example: 

Properties: Use PascalCase for properties, following the same capitalization rule as classes.
Example: public string QuestionNumber { get; set; }

Indentation: Use 4 spaces per indentation level. Do not use tabs.
Spacing:Place one blank line between method definitions.

Curly Braces: Always use curly braces { } for if/else, loops,
and method definitions,even for single-line statements

Single-Line Comments: Use // for single-line comments,
explaining the purpose of code if it’s not immediately clear

File Names: Match the file name with the class name 
it contains for easy navigation.
Example: HomeScreen.cs should contain the HomeScreen class.

SQL Standards:

As per Supabase recommendations, we have lowercase table names and lowercase column names. All SQL code will
be lowercase, as it is postgresql.
Ex:
select * from quiz;

There is flexibility on multi-line statements for readability, but whenever you are trying to use a tab, it
should be 2 spaces.
Ex:
select * from question where choices is not null;
Ex:
select * from question
where choices is not null;
Ex:
select *
from question
  where choices is not null;
Ex:
select title from question
where quiz in (
  select id from quiz
  where creator = 12345
);
