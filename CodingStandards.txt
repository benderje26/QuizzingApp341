Welcome to our group's coding standards! It is split up into a few different sections, and if anything is
confusing, just ask someone else!

C# Standards:

Curly braces are placed on the same line as the method signatures and the same with loops.
Ex: public count(int[] array) {
  for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    count++;
  }
}


SQL Standards:

As per Supabase recommendations, we have lowercase table names and lowercase column names. All SQL code will
be lowercase, as it is postgresql.
Ex:
select * from quiz;

There is flexibility on multi-line statements for readability, but whenever you are trying to use a tab, it
should be 2 spaces.
Ex:
select * from question where choices is not null;
Ex:
select * from question
where choices is not null;
Ex:
select *
from question
  where choices is not null;
Ex:
select title from question
where quiz in (
  select id from quiz
  where creator = 12345
);
