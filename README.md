This is our app for CS 341. Here is our proposal:

Our idea stems from the idea proposed by Sabrina in the App Ideas list as well as our own experience using pollev.com in various CS courses. The idea is
to make a new quizzing app that can be used by instructors in class, or by students studying. The first main function would be creating quizzes, which can
be multiple choice questions or fill in the blank. Another main function will be conducting the quizzes which involves other users (or guests not logged
in) to scan a QR Code or enter a code to enter the quiz. A third function is storing history of past results, so instructors can see how students are 
performing. A fourth function is to be able to favorite quizzes to be able to retake them again.â€‹
